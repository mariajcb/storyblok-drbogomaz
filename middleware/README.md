# MIDDLEWARE

Middleware, in the context of Nuxt, is a navigation guard.  Router is built into Nuxt, so middleware is how you define custom functions that can be run before rendering either a group of pages ("router middleware") or a specific page ("named middleware").

You are using router middleware to detect languages on a page, so that you can apply the appropriate translation. You have not yet provided multiple translations for content, so this folder is aspirational rather than useful.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing#middleware).
