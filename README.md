I built this project for my brother, who is a therapist, when he started his own private practice during the pandemic. 

He wanted:
- a landing page to explain his qualifications and services offered
- a way for his clients to contact him
- a blog that he could update himself, in a no-code way

To meet the requirements, I used:
- a CMS (Storyblok) that my brother could use to update copy and photos
- a free form API (FormCarry).

Storyblok is meant to be used headless, which suited me, because I wanted to focus on showcasing my skills on the front end. I used Vercel for deployment for the same reason; I did not want to get bogged down either with a complex backend or dev ops.

Lately, I have been using this app to test building out a cookie consent manager. Other things on my to-do list are:
- update styles
- write tests

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
