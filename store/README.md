# STORE

This directory takes care of state management.  Nuxt implements it automatically, no need for setup - as long as this directory is called `store` and it contains a file that is not hidden.

## Do not rename this directory or delete index.js

## Notes
- Your store is being used to manage language settings for the app. 
- Right now, the app is only available in English, because you don't have translations for any other languages.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store).
